# The problem definition is what we agree on as a team to solve. 
Problem Definition
The promblem is defined as follows: The need to find likedminded people of a certain topic and to eliminate/deminish lonliness. The topic is unrealised dreams. 

# The assumption is a method that we use to get some of the assumtions out there. As well as to check if the assumtions is realistic.  
The Assumption Dumption:
- It will be a massive success
- We could get good investments
- We could keep the company even after the startup way
- There's a small chance that we could become wealthy
- We would need to put in full working hours eventually to keep the thing running
- There is an opportunity in this sector of the market for unfullfilled dreams
- If we make the "Right It" we will succeed, but if we make whatever we want, we will fail
- Our success or failure ultimately depends on our ability to pursuade people wether it be investments, joining the app or adds. 
- If people wont pay money, we would have to pivot
- Tests are crucial
- People want to match with others for non-romantic partnerships in buisness, art or adventures
- Old people wont try to fullfil their dreams of the past, because they havent tried for a long time and pursuading them to change that will be hard. 
- Younger people may be the ones whom will be most accesible to the app, but not the ones needing it. 
- in the end its probably middle aged people whom should be our focus group, because young people don't have unfullfilled dreams in the same way. Ages 26-45 is what im guessing. 
- Making an artist social media app may have a weakness. That some artists, like musicians and painters prefer to be close to each other when collaborating and that makes the app more dependent on lots of users joining
- Entrepreneurs can collaborate from anywhere in the world, therefore the app would only need a few members to be viable
